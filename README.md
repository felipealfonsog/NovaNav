##### NovaNav written in Rust - beta/testing (experimental alternative in progress)*

Instructions for installation/compiling the program written in Rust*: 

```
cargo install qt_widgets qt_core qt_webengine
cargo add qt_widgets qt_core qt_webengine
```

##### Note: The `qt_webengine` package is not available for all platforms, so you may need to manually download the necessary libraries

`package is required for the web browser functionality of NovaNav, but it's not included by default when installing via cargo. You can add it` 

```
[package]
name = "novanav"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"

[dependencies]
qt_widgets = "0.7"
qt_core = "0.7"
qt_webengine = { git = "https://github.com/rust-qt/qmetaobject.git" }

```

Add that to the [dependencies] section of your `Cargo.toml` file:
```
vim Cargo.toml
```

To test it , run this command on terminal:

```
chmod +x run_novanav_rust.sh
./run_novanav_rust.sh
```

```
rustc src/rust/novanav.rs
./novanav
```

<sub>* It might contain lots of errors, bugs, etc.. Meanwhile, Keep it simple now with Python stable version, running smomothly!</sub>

#

#### To force the link and overwrite all conflicting files (Errors)

[![Errors Reported](https://img.shields.io/badge/Errors_Reported-red)](#)

**If you get this error while you are trying to run the software in the terminal or the software doesn't show up, follow the next steps on macOS or Linux:**

E.g.:

```
user@host src % python3 novanav.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/user/Documents/Development/NovaNav/src/novanav.py", line 2, in <module>
    from PyQt5.QtCore import QUrl, Qt
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5'
```

Install or reinstall pyqt5 with the following command in brew:
E.g.:

```
user@host src % brew install pyqt5
==> Downloading https://formulae.brew.sh/api/formula.jws.json
############################################################################################################ 100.0%
Warning: Formula pyqt5 was renamed to pyqt@5.
==> Downloading https://formulae.brew.sh/api/cask.jws.json
############################################################################################################ 100.0%
Warning: pyqt@5 5.15.10 is already installed, it's just not linked.
To link this version, run:
  brew link pyqt@5
user@host src % brew link pyqt@5
Linking /usr/local/Cellar/pyqt@5/5.15.10... 
Error: Could not symlink bin/pylupdate5
Target /usr/local/bin/pylupdate5
already exists. You may want to remove it:
  rm '/usr/local/bin/pylupdate5'

To force the link and overwrite all conflicting files:
  brew link --overwrite pyqt@5

To list all files that would be deleted:
  brew link --overwrite pyqt@5 --dry-run

```

**So, if you want to delete all files that will be deleted by `brew link --overwrite`, use the `--dry-run` option
Then run,**

```
rm '/usr/local/bin/pylupdate5'
```

```
brew link --overwrite pyqt@5
```

```
brew link --overwrite pyqt@5 --dry-run
```
The last one will show you what would delete if you proceed. If everything looks good, hit return. Then you should have PyQt5 properly installed.

And then try running your program again.

E.g.:

```
user@host src % rm '/usr/local/bin/pylupdate5'
user@host src % brew link --overwrite pyqt@5

Linking /usr/local/Cellar/pyqt@5/5.15.10... 5279 symlinks created.
```

```
user@host src % python3 novanav.py  
```

Then should be fine with no errors. 

<sub>If you still have problems please let me know.
Also if you want to install `pyrcc5` (which is not necessary but can help) just do a normal installation using pip: I am using Python 3.x.</sub>

```
python3 -m venv novanav-env
source novanav-env/bin/activate
```

If not, just go with this:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Runt it with: 

```
python3 ./src/novanav.py
```
