#### To force the link and overwrite all conflicting files (Errors)

**If you get this error while you are trying to run the software in the terminal or the software doesn't show up, follow the next steps on macOS or Linux: **

E.g.:

```
felipe@Felipes-MacBook-Air src % python3 novanav.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/felipe/Documents/Development/NovaNav/src/novanav.py", line 2, in <module>
    from PyQt5.QtCore import QUrl, Qt
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5'
```

Install or reinstall pyqt5 with the following command in brew:
E.g.:

```
felipe@Felipes-MacBook-Air src % brew install pyqt5
==> Downloading https://formulae.brew.sh/api/formula.jws.json
############################################################################################################ 100.0%
Warning: Formula pyqt5 was renamed to pyqt@5.
==> Downloading https://formulae.brew.sh/api/cask.jws.json
############################################################################################################ 100.0%
Warning: pyqt@5 5.15.10 is already installed, it's just not linked.
To link this version, run:
  brew link pyqt@5
felipe@Felipes-MacBook-Air src % brew link pyqt@5
Linking /usr/local/Cellar/pyqt@5/5.15.10... 
Error: Could not symlink bin/pylupdate5
Target /usr/local/bin/pylupdate5
already exists. You may want to remove it:
  rm '/usr/local/bin/pylupdate5'

To force the link and overwrite all conflicting files:
  brew link --overwrite pyqt@5

To list all files that would be deleted:
  brew link --overwrite pyqt@5 --dry-run

```

**So, if you want to delete all files that will be deleted by `brew link --overwrite`, use the `--dry-run` option
Then run,**

```
rm '/usr/local/bin/pylupdate5'
```

```
brew link --overwrite pyqt@5
```

```
brew link --overwrite pyqt@5 --dry-run
```
The last one will show you what would delete if you proceed. If everything looks good, hit return. Then you should have PyQt5 properly installed.

And then try running your program again.

E.g.:

```
felipe@Felipes-MacBook-Air src % rm '/usr/local/bin/pylupdate5'
felipe@Felipes-MacBook-Air src % brew link --overwrite pyqt@5

Linking /usr/local/Cellar/pyqt@5/5.15.10... 5279 symlinks created.
```

```
felipe@Felipes-MacBook-Air src % python3 novanav.py  
```

Then should be fine with no errors. If you still have problems please let me know.
Also if you want to install `pyrcc5` (which is not necessary but can help) just do a normal installation using pip: I am using Python 3.x.

#### Future Goals
#### üöÄ Future Goals

- Implement support for bookmarks to allow users to save their favorite websites for quick access.
- Enhance tab management features, such as rearranging tabs and grouping them into tab sets.
- Improve compatibility with various web standards and technologies to ensure a seamless browsing experience.
- Introduce customization options for user interface themes and keyboard shortcuts to cater to different user preferences.
- Enhance privacy and security features to protect user data and browsing activities from unauthorized access.


#### Requirements & Instructions for compiling and executing manually.

Install Python3, then:

You might need perhaps to create an enviroment for pip: 
```
python3 -m venv novanav-env
source novanav-env/bin/activate
```

If not, just go with this:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Runt it with: 

```
python3 ./src/novanav.py
```

#### How-to - NovaNav

```
ctrl+t (New tab)
