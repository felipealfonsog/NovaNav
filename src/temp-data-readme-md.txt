##### Instructions for Compiling from Source

Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- Qt 5 Base
- Qt 5 WebEngine

Compilation Steps

1. Clone the NovaNav repository from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/felipealfonsog/NovaNav.git
```

Navigate to the directory containing the source code:

```
cd NovaNav/src/cpp
```

Configure the build using qmake. You can adjust parameters as needed:

```
qmake PREFIX=/usr/local
```

Compile the source code:

```
make
```
-->
<!--
Once compilation is complete, the novanav binary will be generated in the current directory.

Installation
To install NovaNav system-wide after compilation, you can use the provided PKGBUILD or manually copy the binary to /usr/local/bin, the icon to /usr/share/pixmaps, and the .desktop file to /usr/share/applications, located in the 'src' folder.

<sub>* It might contain lots of errors, bugs, etc. Meanwhile, Keep it simple now with C++ stable version, running smomothly!</sub>

Important library to install:

```
sudo pacman -S libsoup
```

In Arch, add this line to .bashrc:

```
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
```

 Instructions for installation/compiling the program written in Rust*: 



Add that to the [dependencies] section of your `Cargo.toml` file:
```
vim Cargo.toml
```

To test it , run this command on terminal:

```
chmod +x run_novanav_rust.sh
./run_novanav_rust.sh
```
Compiling: 

```
rustc src/rust/novanav.rs
./novanav
```

<summary><strong>Errors, Fixes and tips</strong></summary>
<br>


To force the link and overwrite all conflicting files (Errors).

If you get this error while you are trying to run the software in the terminal or the software doesn't show up, follow the next steps on macOS or Linux:

E.g.:

```
user@host src % python3 novanav_linux.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/user/NovaNav/src/novanav_linux.py", line 2, in <module>
    from PyQt5.QtCore import QUrl, Qt
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5'
```

Install or reinstall pyqt5 with the following command in brew:
E.g.:

```
user@host src % brew install pyqt5
==> Downloading https://formulae.brew.sh/api/formula.jws.json
############################################################################################################ 100.0%
Warning: Formula pyqt5 was renamed to pyqt@5.
==> Downloading https://formulae.brew.sh/api/cask.jws.json
############################################################################################################ 100.0%
Warning: pyqt@5 5.15.10 is already installed, it's just not linked.
To link this version, run:
  brew link pyqt@5
user@host src % brew link pyqt@5
Linking /usr/local/Cellar/pyqt@5/5.15.10... 
Error: Could not symlink bin/pylupdate5
Target /usr/local/bin/pylupdate5
already exists. You may want to remove it:
  rm '/usr/local/bin/pylupdate5'

To force the link and overwrite all conflicting files:
  brew link --overwrite pyqt@5

To list all files that would be deleted:
  brew link --overwrite pyqt@5 --dry-run

```

**So, if you want to delete all files that will be deleted by `brew link --overwrite`, use the `--dry-run` option
Then run,**

```
rm '/usr/local/bin/pylupdate5'
```

```
brew link --overwrite pyqt@5
```

```
brew link --overwrite pyqt@5 --dry-run
```
The last one will show you what would delete if you proceed. If everything looks good, hit return. Then you should have PyQt5 properly installed.

And then try running your program again.

E.g.:

```
user@host src % rm '/usr/local/bin/pylupdate5'
user@host src % brew link --overwrite pyqt@5

Linking /usr/local/Cellar/pyqt@5/5.15.10... 5279 symlinks created.
```

```
user@host src % python3 novanav.py  
```

Then should be fine with no errors. 

<sub>If you still have problems please let me know.
Also if you want to install `pyrcc5` (which is not necessary but can help) just do a normal installation using pip: I am using Python 3.x.</sub>
